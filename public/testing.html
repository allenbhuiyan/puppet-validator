  <h1>Testing Puppet Code</h1>
  <p>
    This tool will validate the Puppet DSL syntax. It won't actually compile a catalog or
    enforce any configuration state. This means that this <em>only validates syntax</em>.
    There are many ways in which a Puppet manifest may have valid syntax but be completely
    incorrect for your purposes and not do what you intend.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some examples of flaws that will not be identified by this tool include:
    <ul>
      <li>Resource declarations with the incorrect name.</li>
      <li>Including classes that do not exist.</li>
      <li>Packages declarations with an incorrect package name.</li>
      <li>File paths which do not exist on the agent.</li>
      <li><code>exec</code> resources which fail to run properly.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Many other resources exist which can help make sure your code actually works as intended.
